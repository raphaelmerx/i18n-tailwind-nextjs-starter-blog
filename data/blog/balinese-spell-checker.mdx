## The problem: transliterating Balinese

In December 2021, a friend introduced me to the Balinese [WikiPustaka](https://diff.wikimedia.org/2021/11/15/balinese-wikisource-wikipustaka-gives-a-new-life-to-palm-leaf-manuscripts/)
(Wikisource) community, which has been relentlessly working on photographing, transcribing and uploading Balinese palm manuscript (_lontar_) to Wikisource ([example](https://wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Bali-lontar-aji-pangasih-400ppi.pdf/15))

While manuscripts are written using the Balinese alphabet, today most Balinese use the Latin alphabet when reading or writing in the Balinese language.
Text written in the Balinese alphabet can be automatically transliterated to the Latin alphabet ([using Benny Lin's translitator](https://bennylin.github.io/transliterasijawa/bali.html)),
however since words in the Balinese alphabet are not separated by spaces, after transliteration we're missing spaces between words.
To produce legible Balinese in the Latin alphabet, we need to guess where spaces are after transliteration.

## Our solution: a space fixer + a spell checker

So we embarked on a small project teaching a model to guess spaces in Balinese text.
Using SymSpell trained on Balinese text scraped from the Balinese Wikipedia, we put together a first version of our "Balinese space fixer":

<div className="flex flex-wrap -mx-2 overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
  <div className="my-1 px-2 w-full overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-1/2 text-center">
    <Image
      alt="spacefixer"
      src="/static/images/balinese_space_fixer.jpeg"
      width={450}
      height={350}
    />
  </div>
</div>

Later on, we expanded this tool to also make spelling corrections.
And added a way for the community to fix bad spelling suggested by the system. And thus the "Balinese Spell Checker" was born:

<div className="flex flex-wrap -mx-2 overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
  <div className="my-1 px-2 w-full overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-1/2 text-center">
    <Image
      alt="spellchecker"
      src="/static/images/balinese_spell_checker.jpeg"
      width={500}
      height={350}
    />
    <Image alt="editspelling" src="/static/images/edit_spelling.jpeg" width={500} height={350} />
  </div>
</div>

The tool can be accessed at https://balinese-spell.netlify.app/, with its source code living at https://github.com/raphaelmerx/ban-spellcheck.

## What's next?

To assist the WikiPustaka community, which is so far manually transcribing lontar, we would love to create a reasonable quality OCR engine for Balinese manuscripts.
I'm looking into using [eScriptorium](https://escriptorium.inria.fr/) and [kraken](http://kraken.re/master/index.html) to do so.

In the longer-term, a translation engine between Indonesian and Balinese would be great.
While I'm trying to keep the hopes of the WikiPustaka community low on this front,
I'm actively following research on very low-resource machine translation, especially that coming from the
[Masakhane (NLP for African languages)](https://github.com/masakhane-io/masakhane-mt) community.
