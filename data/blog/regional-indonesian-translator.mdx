### Machine Translation (MT) for Balinese: out of reach?

Four years in Timor-Leste and pandemic lockdowns gave me ample time and incentives to develop [tetun.org](https://tetun.org/),
a machine translation service for the Tetun language.
After I moved to Indonesia in 2020, I became more and more interested in its regional languages, Balinese in particular.

Machine translation systems rely on large amounts of written text to train themselves.
Since I could find significantly less text for Balinese than I did for Tetun,
my hopes for creating a machine translation system for the language were initially low.
However, fast advances in low-resource machine translation, in particular by the [Masakhane](https://www.masakhane.io/) community
leveraging existing multilingual models, raised my hopes that machine translation for Balinese was within reach.

### NLLB and its many regional Indonesian languages

It was with some surprise though that I read that Meta AI’s latest translation model, [NLLB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04672),
not only covered **Balinese**, but also several other regional Indonesian languages that have no widely-used translation systems,
namely **Acehnese, Banjarese, Buginese, and the Minangkabau language**.
This came on top of better machine translation quality for Javanese and Sundanese than Google Translate!

So after trying out NLLB, and getting some motivation from my friend [Joseagush](https://twitter.com/joseagush/) to look further into it, I set out to put together a website that would leverage NLLB for regional Indonesian languages, alongside English and Indonesian.
We published it on Twitter and it [kinda blew up](https://twitter.com/RaphaelMerx/status/1548521949936381953)!

### Looking ahead

The interest this generated motivates me to develop it. There’s no shortage of potential improvements:

- Improve **translation quality** for existing languages, especially through finding text covering different domains (news, educational content, everyday conversations)…
  - … and better handle different registers for each language -- see [this thread on Sundanese](https://twitter.com/luthorean/status/1548926830610026498)
- **Add more languages**, in particular there is hope for [Madurese](https://twitter.com/ahsaniyye/status/1548628284178857985), [Ngaju](https://twitter.com/awakutuleksikon/status/1548552342026727424) and [Batak](https://twitter.com/kindagirll/status/1548685762316718080)
- Polish the website **design**, this is still a prototype!
- Add dictionary entries, with examples for each of them, like we do on tetun.org
- And one day produce a **mobile app**…
  - which ideally would work offline, so people in remote areas can translate without having internet access

There’s plenty of work ahead, but each task is fascinating in itself.

### Improvements through symbiosis

It’s worth acknowledging here how valuable text from **Wikipedia** is when training MT systems.
Thanks to its (high-quality content that covers many different domains (history, science, politics, etc),
Wikipedia is a gold mine for finding training data.
Similarly, once an MT system has been setup for a language,
it can be used by Wikipedia editors to assist them in creating new articles from translations.

Overall, **Indonesia is a fascinating country for machine translation**,
because even though its languages range from high-resource (Indonesian, and to a lesser extent Javanese)
to low-resource, the close relationship between different languages means that a multilingual system
learns “closely related” languages together.
For example, a system that already knows Javanese will need less text to learn Balinese
than a system that is trained exclusively on Balinese text.
This is useful technologically, and in my opinion, a beautiful symbol for the country.
